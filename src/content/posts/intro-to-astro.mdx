# Introduction to Astro.js

Astro.js is a modern web framework that aims to make building fast, efficient websites easier than ever. It combines the best aspects of static site generation with the dynamic capabilities of traditional server-rendered applications. In this post, we'll provide a brief introduction to Astro.js and get you started with your first Astro.js project.

## Getting Started with Astro.js

To get started with Astro.js, you'll need to install it first. Use npm or yarn to install Astro globally:

`npm install -g create-astro` 

Once installed, create a new Astro.js project:

```
create-astro my-astro-project
cd my-astro-project
npm install
npm run dev
```
